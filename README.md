# Advance Data Programming with R

This repository contains homework assignments for the course **Advance Data Programming with R**.

## Repository Structure

- `Homework/` — Contains homework assignments.
  - `homework1/` — Example: Analysis of the Iris dataset using R and Quarto.
    - `howework_1.qmd` — Quarto file with code and analysis.
    - `howework_1.pdf` — Rendered PDF of the homework.
    - `homework1.Rproj` — RStudio project file.

## Homework Example

**Homework 1** explores the classic Iris dataset, performing statistical analysis and visualization using R. The analysis includes:
- Summary statistics by species
- Scatter plots of petal length vs. petal width
- Interpretation of results for classification

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio for a project-based workflow.
3. Open `.qmd` files in RStudio or Quarto-compatible editors to view or run the code.
4. Render Quarto files to PDF or HTML using the Quarto extension in RStudio or the command line:
   ```bash
   quarto render howework_1.qmd
   ```

## Requirements
- R (version 4.0 or higher recommended)
- RStudio (optional, for project workflow)
- Quarto (for rendering `.qmd` files)
- R packages: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `knitr`
